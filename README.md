# VBA- Challenge Results 

# This script is analyzing the stock data through out each quarter, to give us a more extensive understanding of each stock.
 
# In this project I built a script to get the following outcomes:

# The ticker symbol

# Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

# The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

# The total stock volume of the stock.

# In addition to this, this script also highlights the following:
# The stock with the greatest percentage increase
# The stock with the lowest percentage increase
# The stock with the greatest total volume

# I would like to point out that I had help of a totur and Xpert learning assistant.
